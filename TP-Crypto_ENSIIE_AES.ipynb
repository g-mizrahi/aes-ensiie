    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1997 the NIST calls for proposal for a new cryptosystem to replace DES and 3DES. An open process started including the whole international scientific community.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2001 the [_Rijndael_](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf) cipher is chosen as the new _Advanced Encryption Standard_ AES. The cipher had been invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen from Belgium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other candidate ciphers were proposed : Mars by IBM, RC6 by RSA Laboratories, [Serpent](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html) by Anderson, Biham and Knudsen and [Twofish](https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1998/12/the_twofish_encrypti.html) by Schneier and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2001 AES is approved as a US federal standard. In 2003 the NSA allows AES to encrypt TOP SECRET documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of AES\n",
    "\n",
    "AES is a block cipher operating on blocks of 128 bits. It accepts keys of size 128, 192 or 256 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/figure_01.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note : the size of the key does not change the size of the blocks, it is always 128 bits for AES.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of AES\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "AES performs operations on both the key and the plaintext in rounds. Each round consists of operations on the key and on the plaintext that can be performed in parralel and are \"combined\" at the end of the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the length of the key, AES will perform 10 rounds (128 bits key), 12 rounds (192 bits key) or 14 rounds (256 bits key).\n",
    "\n",
    "The plaintext is cut in blocks of 128 bits and each block is visualized as a 4 by 4 matrix of bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/figure_02.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round of operations on a block consists of three layers :\n",
    "- XOR with the round key (obtained as the result of the key derivation schedule)\n",
    "- Substitution layer (S-box) changing the bytes to add _confusion_\n",
    "- Diffusion layer mixing rows and columns to add _diffusion_\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round of operation on the key aims at producing a 128 bits round key from the original key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note : the size of the round key is always the same size as the block (128 bits) regardless of the size of the original key.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/figure_03.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",

    "### Decryption\n",
    "\n",
    "The key schedule can be computed independently and all the operations on the cipher text are invertible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computations are done over a Galois field $GF(2^8)$\n",
    "- As AES was defined as a standard is has been implemented in hardware\n",
    "- As of today there are no known efficient attacks on AES itself (vulnerabilities exist in some modes of operations)"
